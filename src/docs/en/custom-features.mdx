# 🚀 Custom Features in Our Kepler.gl Integration

We’ve extended the core **[Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)** package to better suit our project needs.  
Below you’ll find an overview of the new functionality, why we added it, and how to use it.

## 🌍 Multi-Language Support

We added **Deutsch (German)** as an additional language option.

- Users can easily switch between English and German.
- All UI labels, menus, and tooltips have been translated.
- This helps make the platform accessible to a wider audience in the DACH region.

> 💡 _If you’d like to contribute more translations, check out the `i18n` folder in the repo._

## 📊 Predefined Example Cards

To help users explore data immediately, we added two **preloaded map cards**:

1. **Road Roughness Data**

   - Displays road condition datasets (roughness indices).
   - Allows filtering and comparison between different road sections.

2. **Overtaking Distances**
   - Visualizes measured overtaking distances on selected routes.
   - Helps researchers and traffic engineers analyze safety-related patterns.

Users can open these cards directly from the dashboard and interact with them like any other Kepler.gl map.

## 🔐 Supabase Integration for User Accounts

We integrated **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** to manage authentication and persistent storage.

### ✨ What this enables:

- **User Accounts** – Register and log in securely.
- **Save Maps** – Store your custom maps in your profile.
- **CRUD Operations** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete maps anytime.
- **Collaboration Ready** – In the future, we can allow map sharing across accounts.

### 🔧 How it works:

- When a user logs in, their maps are automatically fetched from Supabase.
- Saving a map writes its configuration + dataset references to Supabase.
- Updates are synced instantly, so you can always pick up where you left off.
- Deleting a map removes it both from the UI and the Supabase backend.
